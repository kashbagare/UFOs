# UFOs

## Overview of Project
In this module challenge, we used our newly learned JavaScript skills and our HTML skills to create a website about UFO sightings. On the website, we can filter the data by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape in order to see UFO sightings at a particular place or time. 

## Results 
When you click on index.html, you will be redirecting to a webpage called UFO Sightings and "The Truth is Out There".

Towards the bottom of the screen, you will see a filter search where you can filter the UFO sighting data by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape any combination of these.

For example, if you type in "ca" in the "Enter the State" option and then "light" in the "Enter a Shape" option, the data will automatically filter to show UFO sightings from California and sightings involving lights.

## Summary
One drawback is that we can't customize the duration section of the data. I would recommend maybe adding code that would allow us to filter the duration from longest amount of time to smallest amount of time (or vice versa). I would also recommend maybe adding a search filter for common phrases that UFO enthusiasts use in order to filter the comments (if a user wants to see if a recorded sighting in the data matched something they have seen themselves).
